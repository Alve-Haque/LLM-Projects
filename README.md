# LLM Projects using Open-Source APIs

Welcome to my **LLM Projects Repository** — a space where I experiment with and build exciting applications using **Large Language Models** powered by **open-source APIs**.  

Each project explores a different aspect of natural language understanding, including:
- 💬 Conversational AI  
- 🧠 Text summarization & reasoning  
- 🧩 Code generation & transformation  
- 🔍 Information retrieval & semantic search  
- 🎨 Creative text and content generation  

### Tech Stack
- Python / JavaScript (depending on project)
- Open-source LLM APIs (e.g., Hugging Face, Ollama, LM Studio, etc.)
- Streamlit / FastAPI / LangChain (for app integrations)

###  Goal
To learn, experiment, and contribute to the **open-source AI ecosystem** by building practical and creative projects powered by language models.

###  Contributions
Feel free to open issues or share ideas for collaboration.  
Together, we can push the boundaries of what open-source LLMs can do!
